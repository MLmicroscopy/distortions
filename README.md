# DISTORSIONS

## Summary:

This repository provides the code to undistord EBSD data (.ang format) based on segmented electron images by using CMA-ES algorithms [1].

[TODO]: add example

## Dependencies:
This works on python3 (not tested on python2). You need to install the following package
 - sklean
 - skimage
 - cma
 - opencv (will be removed)

## Disortion pipeline:
[TODO] add sketch
 
## Instructions:

The process relies on two scripts:
 - align.py 
 - distord.py
 
### Align 
 
align.py computes a linear transformation (rescale/rotate/translate) of the segmented electron data and fit it to the ebsd size.
In order to find the best linear alignment, it performs a grid search over 3 parameters: the angle (degree), tx (pixels), ty (pixels).
Note that the rescale parameters must be pre-determined by the user.
This script relies on a json config file (e..g conf/AM718.conf).

```
{
  "rescale": {        # Determine the rescale the segemented image to the ESDB scale (set 1 if no rescale is required)
    "x": 0.9,
    "y": 0.9
  },
  "grid_search": {    # The grid search will iterate over the range of parameters define by the user
    "rotate": {       # Rotation (degree)
      "start": -1.5,  
      "end": 0.5,
      "step": 0.5
    },
    "translate_x": {  # horizontal translation (pixels)
      "start": -320,
      "end": -250,
      "step": 1
    },
    "translate_y": {  # vertical translation (pixels)
      "start": -150,
      "end": -90,
      "step": 1
    }
  }
}
```

As a rule of thumb, we recommend you to first use the script with a large range windows and step size.  
Once you located the range of interest, refine the grid search within a smaller range and a small step size.

If you want to run align.py on our sample, use the following instruction:
```
$> python3 align.py \
        -seg_ref_path ../data/AM718/segment/AM718_segment.png
        -ebsd_ref_path ../data/AM718/ebsd/AM718_ebsd.jpg
        -align_dir ../data/AM718/segment.align/
        -out_dir ../data/AM718/out
        -conf_path ../conf/AM718.align.conf
        -xp_id 0
```

align.py dumps:
 - ${align_dir}/segment.align.${xp_id}.png: segmented electron data that best fit the current EBSD speckle
 - ${out_dir}/overlap.align.${xp_id}.png: the overlap between the re-align segmented electron image and the EBSD image before correction
 - ${out_dir}/affine.${xp_id}.json: the parameters of the linear transformation (json file)

### Distord
The next step is to find the undistord that will macth the EBSD speckles to the segmented electron data0.
To do so, we use the CMA-ES algorithm that will compute intermediate distorted mesh, and use them to compute a polynomial distortion.
For more details, please have a look to our paper.

distord.py dumps:
 - ${out_dir}/ebsd_distord.${xp_id}.png: the EBSD after the polynomial distorsion
 - ${out_dir}/mesh_distord.${xp_id}.png: the EBSD and the mesh used to compute the polynomial distortion  
 - ${out_dir}/overlap.distord.${xp_id}.png: the overlap between the re-align segmented electron image and the EBSD image after correction
 - ${out_dir}/params.${xp_id}.png: the parameters of the polynomial transformation and the mesh (json file)

     
If you want to run align.py on our sample, use the following instruction:

```
$> python3 align.py \
        -seg_ref_path ../data/AM718/segment.align/segment.align.0.png
        -ebsd_ref_path ../data/AM718/ebsd/AM718_ebsd.jpg
        -ang_ref_path ../data/AM718/ang/AM718.ang
        -out_dir ../data/AM718/out
        -conf_path ../conf/AM718.align.conf
        -xp_id 0
```
Note: Do not forget to unzip the file data/AM718/ang/AM718.zip !

You can also change the mesh properties with the following argument:
```
 -mesh_step     # number of pixels between two mesh points. 
 -mesh_std      # number of pixels (std) that CMA-ES may move the mesh point at each iteration
 -num_sampling  # number of mesh to generate by CMA-ES
 -polynom       # degree of the polynom for the polynomial distortion
```
   
You can also change the ang phase name/formula with the following argument:
```
 -phase_name     # Name of the phase in the ang description
 -phase_formula  # Chemical formula to display in the ang descrition

```
